Ôû▓ [WARNING] Comparison with -0 using the "===" operator will also match 0 [equals-negative-zero]

    .open-next/server-functions/default/handler.mjs:2257:36323:
      2257 Ôöé ...<0)x7+=moduloVal;else if(x7===-0)return 0}return x7}}__name(c...

  Floating-point equality is defined such that 0 and -0 are equal, so "x === -0" returns true for both 0 and -0. You need to use "Object.is(x, -0)" instead to test for -0.


Ôû▓ [WARNING] Duplicate key "options" in object literal [duplicate-object-key]

    .open-next/server-functions/default/handler.mjs:6053:312827:

  The original key "options" is here:

Ôû▓ [WARNING] The "typeof" operator will never evaluate to "null" [impossible-typeof]

    .open-next/server-functions/default/handler.mjs:6068:107:

           ÔòÁ                                ~~~~~~

  The expression "typeof x" actually evaluates to "object" in JavaScript, not "null". You need to use "x === null" to test for null.
